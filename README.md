# integrate-automation
this repository contains the configuration and code for a CI/CD pipeline for our project using Google Cloud Build. Google Cloud Build is a fully managed, serverless CI/CD service provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

# What We're Doing:
Automatically building and deploying our applications whenever changes are pushed to this repository.
Leveraging Google Cloud Build's managed environment to handle the build process without managing dedicated VM servers.
Utilizing a cloudbuild.yaml file to define our build steps, including building, testing, and deploying our applications.
Integrating with Google Cloud services for deployment (e.g., Google App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine) as our project requires.
By automating our CI/CD pipeline with Google Cloud Build, we ensure reliable and consistent deployments while reducing the operational overhead associated with managing infrastructure. Our project is more efficient and scalable, allowing us to focus on delivering quality software.

Feel free to adjust this description to match the specifics of your project, and include any additional information that you find relevant. This description will help visitors to your repository understand the purpose and setup of your CI/CD pipeline
